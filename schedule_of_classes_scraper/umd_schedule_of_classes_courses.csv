It will do so through three sections: section one will introduce students to classical, cultural, and media concepts as well as relevant keywords outlined by Asian American Studies scholars; section two will review the work of Asian American cultural theorists; section three will focus on analyses of particular Asian American cultural productions. In doing so, students will gain an understanding of the shifting and interlocking tensions among the local, the national, and the global that form the cultural geographies of Asian America."

It covers the history of racial, gendered, and sexualized representations of Asian Americans in Hollywood, as well as Asian American filmic responses within and outside Hollywood. It also introduces how four basic tools of film analysis mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing and sound work together to create meaning in moving images. It examines how these elements are put together in three different types of films by Asian American filmmakers: narrative, documentary, and experimental. How films function in society to circulate ideas that reproduce and challenge stereotypes about Asian Americans."

Beginning with early to mid-twentieth century representations, the course attends to theories that clarify the contested relationship between the East/West and Asia/U.S. Also examined are the methods through which bodies differentiated by sex, gender, and race are managed, surveilled, and rehabilitated, with close attention to the enduring legacies of American expansionism and conquest, anti-immigration policies in the U.S., and twentieth-century wars and occupations in Asia.

As well as being the ultimate laboratory for studying the nature of space and time, they drive some of the most energetic and extreme phenomena known to astronomers (with quasars and gamma-ray bursts being just a couple of examples).  In this introduction to the physics and astrophysics of black holes, we start by examining the basic physics of black holes, which fundamentally means understanding gravity.  We then look at the nature of stellar-mass black holes and supermassive black holes.  We will discuss the fairly recent realization that black holes may be crucial agents for regulating the growth of galaxies.  Finally, we dive into the realm of theoretical physics and probe how black holes may provide a route for uncovering new laws of physics governing the structure of space and time."

In the near future, the dependence of humans on AI for a myriad of social activities including companionship and care is also expected to accelerate.  This course deals with the question of how we should ensure AI will create ethical economic and social systems that reflect the kind of world we want to live in 20 to 30 years from now.

Topics such as political participation and engagement in politics, lawfulness and justice, freedom and autonomy, democracy and civic responsibility are found at the core of Ancient Greek thought.  In addition to these topics, the course explores, through the teachings of ancient Greek philosophers, historians, and poets, the questions of virtue and happiness at a personal level and the pursuit of happiness at the societal level. Love and friendship are necessary virtues to shape a harmonious and prosperous polis. By studying selected excerpts from the primary sources of Ancient Greek literature in translation, the course defines the core values of democratic society from the viewpoint of the Greeks."

We will pay particular attention to how hierarchical inequalities are institutionalized, experienced, and represented and to how different marginalized and dominant groups interacted. Enslaved persons performed necessary labor in Greece and Rome and their work was essential for the formation of ancient society in agriculture, mining, domestic spaces, literature, finance, and government. Studying ancient slavery offers a chance to examine Greece and Rome from the bottom up, parsing the scant literary and material evidence for the lives and struggles of enslaved persons. We will practice several different approaches in order to tease out the systematic, economic, political, and personal effects of slavery in the ancient world. The United States of America was also founded as a slave society, and discussions of slavery in the Americas often look back to the ancient Mediterranean. The course will therefore conclude with a unit on how enslavers and abolitionists in the United States utilized and responded to slavery in antiquity."

In this case, a picture is worth a thousand words: visualizations enable us to transform data into images that are easier to understand and reason about, compared to raw numbers and raw text. Visualizations are critical tools in externalizing and organizing our knowledge and insights, whether to explore collected datasets to improve our understanding of the physical world, to assess and debug analysis/experimental workflows, or to present new and interesting results to diverse audiences. In this course we will study techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualizations based on principles from graphic design, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science. Students will learn how to design and build interactive visualizations for the web, using the D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) framework."

In the first semester, our content focused on community; we built community as a program of unique individuals to create a common identity and discussed the ways in which the science community exists. The second semester allowed us to explore the life sciences through our lenses of curiosity; we asked big questions and moved toward big answers. This semester is focused on engagement. We will take time to be fully present in the life sciences community and learn why it is important to gain practical knowledge and experiences to further the goals and aims of science."

The field of science communication ventures that the answer is not simply a matter of improving capacity (e.g., because people lack scientific information, scientists lack communication skills, or both). Rather, it calls for sustained collaboration and empathy between laypersons and experts. In this hands-on, experiential course, we use a model of cultural competency to put forth solutions to bridge the expert-lay divide. We investigate typical venues in which science is communicated (museums, YouTube videos, federal agency websites, and much much more) and study best practices for communication. Then we explore emerging venues that support sustained contact between so-called ""lay citizens"" and scientific or technical experts (dance/improv techniques, ethnographic methods and citizen science). Students learn to use cross-cultural perspectives as a basis to pilot and test ways of strengthening relationships and improving communication."

We often take for granted the services infrastructure bring us. As a consequence, the United States, which at one time was a world leader in creating infrastructure, is experiencing an infrastructure crisis. Furthermore, not everyone experiences this issue equally. This course is designed to identify the root causes of the crisis. You will explore emerging social, political, legal, cultural, and social justice issues associated with the building and maintenance of infrastructure from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and engineers. You will work with a volunteer corps of professional engineers from a variety of disciplines on a service-learning project designed to assess the safety and vitality of infrastructure."

Several of the basic methods and tools of field research and the applied management of ecosystems will be discussed and demonstrated with several field excursions in the natural environs of the DC area. Central to this course will be the understanding that modern human society is an integral part of nature, with the power to impact and influence elements of the natural world at multiple scales. An analysis of policy implications for the biosphere will be discussed."

In urban areas, the concentration of people and the drastic changes in land use, have altered the fluxes of water, sediments, chemicals, and microorganisms. As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed. In this course we take a systems approach to urban water hydrology, engineering, planning and management. We will explore urban water cycle, urban runoff and drainage characteristics, urban water supply and demand, stormwater collection and treatment and designing best management practices. Additionally, we look at the climate impacts on the urban water cycle."

Second, from a practitioner's perspective, students will explore the U.S. innovation ecosystem in the context of world affairs across industry, academia, government, and venture. By doing so they can also examine potential career paths in building technology power to improve international security.  Third, students will gain practical experience from studying cases in innovation power and build their own tech strategy as a capstone experience. Through all three phases of the class, artificial intelligence will be used as the base case and the most important general purpose technology of our day thus gaining an appreciation for AI itself on one hand, and how it is but one example of how technology can impact the destiny of nations on the other."

To do this, we will use research, and an understanding of adolescent development, to explore and analyze issues affecting the health and behavior of American adolescents. Such issues include (but are not limited to) sex education, the role of social media in mental health, substance use, policing in schools, dating violence, suicide prevention, access to sexual and reproductive health care, and school start times. We will consider how adolescent well-being is shaped by social contexts, including the role of parents and family members, peers, schools, communities, social media, and culture. We will examine policies and programs that affect adolescents, how effective they are at promoting adolescent health, and how they might be improved to better support healthy adolescent development."

This course looks at conventional families created in unconventional ways to examine such topics as sperm and egg donation, in vitro fertilization, surrogacy, reproductive organ transplants and more - while considering the social, cultural, racial, religious, economic, or socioeconomic contexts that influence each. Students will work with their foreign peers in small groups to compare ART in each country and then create proposed legislation for either the U.S. or Brazil which their international group will present online to their colleges and submit to the country's legislators.  In so doing, students will be challenged to think critically and see their place in creating actionable change in a global society."

Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain."

Now, we are in a new era: real life is catching up with fiction. Nations have sent extended missions to the Moon and Mars, and recently the OSIRIS-Rex brought rocks and dust from the asteroid 101955 Bennu down to Earth. To understand how real life can catch up with fiction (or cannot), we look at liquid crystals, the substances that are the secret of life itself. Liquid crystals are all around and in us. They are the material used in the displays that surround us - telephones, t.v.s, and computers - and the molecules that make life possible. In short, they are essential to us and to everything else that lives. Through a study of liquid crystals and their phases, students will learn the tools to address such pressing concerns as why extremes of temperature and pressure affect life the way they do, and what we can do about it."

With a focus on why a socio-environmental systems approach can help illuminate the environmental, socio-cultural, economic, and intersectional dimensions of sustainability, we will explore what different disciplines bring to this complex topic and use qualitative and quantitative approaches to grapple with problems of sustainability. How do we work with stakeholders to identify the vulnerable, the equitable paths forward, and the trade-offs? Who are the winners and losers of policy decisions?

Surveillance is a ubiquitous practice in contemporary society. Governments surveil populations; corporations surveil customers and users; and individuals surveil themselves and others. From red light cameras and doorbell security cameras to geo-tracking apps and smart appliances, surveillant practices shape 21st-century lifestyles. Many take these practices for granted as acceptable trade-offs for individual and collective benefits. Others sound the alarm on the dangers of being tracked and monitored, with concerns over individual liberty, social inequalities, and more. In this course we will debate how surveillance shapes social practices and selves. Students will draw their own conclusions about the role of surveillance in society, and what, if anything, should be done to change it."

From definitions of consciousness and the potential for robots to claim rights to the gender implications of AI, we will explore its philosophical and political implications. As AI is also capital, we will interrogate what the advance of AI means to capitalists and for labor. Finally, we will enter the debate around whether AI will require more than machine learning to approximate general intelligence and whether it can truly be creative.

At the same time, humans have grappled with fears and innovation through speculative fiction far longer than these ideas have had practical applications. Landmark stories of artificial life include beings in Greek mythology (Talos), Jewish lore (golem), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and more to the present day.

It was a term coined by cognitive psychologist and designer Don Norman in the 1990s on the cusp of the new digital era; however, the field in practice has existed long before that. Unfortunately, due to its over use and misuse, the pure concept of UX has become lost in the weeds and details of all of its components and methods. In this course, we will take a deep look at the true meaning of UX as simply ""a user's experience"" and what that means for you as both a designer and a user. You will learn about core UX principles and methodologies from both an academic and practical standpoint and be challenged to apply what you learn in classroom workshops and assignments. Finally, you will be asked to think both inside and outside the bounds of technology to find innovative solutions to real world design problems.

This course investigates the principles and practices of sustainable agriculture and their relationship to the greater food system. We will explore the social (people), environmental (planet), and economic (profit) impacts of agriculture - from challenges to opportunities. INAG123 applies the principles of sustainability to various agricultural production practices and systems - at a range of different scales - to see what lessons these varied models can offer. Along the way, we will consider domestic issues such as food safety and distribution, food justice, cultural relevance, biodiversity, farming communities, and effects on local economies.Students will have in person field trips scheduled and must provide their own transportation (actual dates to be determined)."

You might care deeply about an issue, and want to make a difference, but don't know where to start. Sometimes you might not even try. This course will equip and empower you to delve deep into understanding a social issue of your choosing. Through course materials and activities, you'll try out your changemaker muscles and mindsets. Our goal is that this course will empower you to be an informed, engaged citizen who contributes to your community with and beyond your profession.

This course endeavors to delve into the dynamic relationship between the pillars of aesthetics and the core skills of Design Thinking (DT), all with the goal of enhancing the design process. Throughout the course, we will witness instances where DT bolsters Visual Communication (VC), and conversely, where VC lends its support to the DT process. Our exploration will revolve around three pivotal questions: How can we engage users and establish meaningful connections with them? How can we empathize with users' challenges and provide them with effective solutions? How can we embrace a holistic approach to design?"

The question is ancient, but recent decades have seen great progress in the cognitive science of language, while expanding the diversity of languages investigated. We know much more about how languages vary, how they develop in children, how they are encoded in the mind, and relate to other domains of cognition. Major developments in statistical computation and research on animal cognition also illuminate what is (not) possible without the particular structure of the human mind. We bring this all to bear on our Big Question: What makes human language special from the viewpoint of meaning? Students will come to understand the major features of language as a vehicle for complex thought and a tool for communication. They will use this understanding in analyzing common semantic patterns and everyday conversational dynamics."

Continuation in MATH115 is conditional on the student passing the MATHEMATICS PLACEMENT EXAM at the appropriate level. Topics include exponents, polynomials, linear equations in one and two variables, quadratic equations, as well as polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithm functions and trigonometry. MATH015 does not carry any credit toward any degree at the University, nor is it graded. It leads directly to MATH115 (or MATH107 or MATH113), or MATH003, all of which are graded.There is a special fee for this class in addition to the regular tuition charge."

Although the United States has long been praised for its inclusiveness vis-a-vis citizenship - including a policy of jus soli, or birthright citizenship - a closer look reveals a difficult history involving the categorical exclusion of many groups from American citizenship. We will examine this history, focusing particularly on Black and Native Americans and immigrants, and drawing upon legal cases, historical texts, and personal narratives detailing the lived experiences of those seeking American citizenship. We will trace this history to the present and explore the current process and requirements for becoming an American citizen.

Other than its constitutional justification, why do we need and have a U.S. Supreme Court? What are some of the most important opinions issued by the Supreme Court that changed society, for the good, and bad? Who are the Court's most important justices? And most of all, how does the Court work? This course will trace the development of the constitutional doctrine of the Court, the growth of the Court's institutional power, and the Court s interaction with Congress, the president, and society. Discussed are major constitutional law decisions, their political contexts, and the social and behavioral factors that affect judges, justices, and federal court jurisprudence. There will be a strong emphasis on how the Court's decisions have impacted law and society and how the Court helps to maintain a certain kind of society."

What is the meaning of life? Does it have a single meaning or any meaning(s) at all? What kind of meaning is even at issue when we inquire into life's meaning? Is a meaningful life a good life? Are things like pleasure, knowledge, beauty, or achievements ingredients of a good life? Why if so? If life can be meaningful, then it seems like it makes sense to want it to never end- it makes sense to want to be immortal. But does it? Could an immortal life be a meaning ful life? If not, then that seems to suggest that death isn't so bad. But death also seemsquite bad! What is it about death that makes it bad? Is it possible to make sense of death in a philosophically rigorous way? These are some of the many questions that will be explored in this course, using texts and tools from the intellectual tradition of contemporary analytic Western philosophy."

We consider how Asian American femininities/masculinities are conceived and circulated, drawing from a diverse selection of twentieth-century and contemporary texts, films and images that connect Asian American bodies to ideas of absence, danger, inscrutability, hyper- or hypo-sexuality, and virulence. Beginning with early to mid-twentieth century representations, the course attends to theories that clarify the contested relationship between the East/West and Asia/U.S. Also examined are the methods through which bodies differentiated by sex, gender, and race are managed, surveilled, and rehabilitated, with close attention to the enduring legacies of American expansionism and conquest, anti-immigration policies in the U.S., and twentieth-century wars and occupations in Asia. The course engages Women of Color feminisms, queer theory, and disability studies."
