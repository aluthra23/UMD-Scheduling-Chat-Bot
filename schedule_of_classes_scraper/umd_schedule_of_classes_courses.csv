Structural violence conceptualizes the ways social structures, institutions and systems are complicit in the harm of specific populations (e.g., shortened life expectancy among African Americans). These harms are often preventable. Structural and interpersonal violence, specifically community firearm violence, impacts the physical, psychological, social and emotional well-being, and quality of life of African-Americans, a demographic disproportionately impacted by the harms caused by structural and interpersonal violence. Using an interdisciplinary, structural justice and anti-racist approach this course examines the intersection of structuralviolence, interpersonal violence and trauma in African-American communities impacted by gun violence."

Most people think they know but if you ask people to explain the differences and similarities you're bound to get a range of answers. Weather affects not just our daily activities but other important aspects of society such as transportation, commerce, security and agriculture. Most people understand what weather is to some extent. Climate and climate change are concepts that evoke strong emotional responses from people but are less well understood. In this class, students examine fundamental issues such as the greenhouse effect, severe weather, and global weather patterns and how they relate to a changing climate.

Students will also have a chance to interact directly with the collection of the David C. Driskell Center throughout the semester."

Afrofuturism encompasses a network of Black artists who are geographically diverse and whose creative explorations are located at the intersection of art, technoculture, and Black identity. These visual artists, writers, musicians, and filmmakers engage different mediums and technologies to articulate new futures through a Black cultural lens, often with a space-age theme. Throughout this course, we will trace the Afrofuturist point of view in 20th and 21st century Black speculative fiction, film, music, and the visual arts. We will analyze fiction by authors like Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, study artworks by Wangechi Mutu, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Yinka Shonibare, explore the music and visual output by Sun Ra, Parliament Funkadelic, and Janelle Mone and consider films such as ""Black Panther."""

Students will consider a wide range of art forms (painting, photography, video, installation, web-based media, and film) in four broad themes (uses of the past; critiques of power; representations of race, gender, and sexuality; socially engaged art) and explore the complex intertwining of the political, historical, and aesthetic aspects in Chinese contemporary art and film, as well as the multiple contexts in which these artworks are created and circulated."

At its core, addressing this question requires understanding the balance between genetic and non-genetic factors underlying human diversity.  The course will help students make an informed critique of the biological basis of race through the study of topics such as: basic biology, data analysis and experimental design, human evolution and genetics, and biomedical research and health outcomes.(Sponsoring Dept.: BIOL)."

A comprehensive overview of the field of behavioral endocrinology, the study of the relationship between hormones and behavior, from a psychobiological perspective. Examine the major mammalian endocrine systems, how hormones influence sex determination, how hormones underlie sex differences in brain structure and function, the role of hormones in parental and social behaviors, mood disorders, homeostasis, cognition, and stress. Both normal and abnormal hormonal pathologies will be discussed. Due to the physiological and experimental perspectives, much of the phenomenology will be based on research in species other than humans. This species comparative approach will reveal interesting ""ways of doing things"" that are intriguingly different from how ""humans do things."""

CE), and the philosopher Epictetus (c. 55-135 CE)--give us a rare glimpse into the internal experience of persons enslaved and emancipated by Roman elites. To contextualize these experiences, we study the legal basis of Roman slavery, epigraphic self-representations, and stereotyping representations of freedpersons by free authors. We also read our authors against comparable works by freeborn analogues--the senator Cicero, the poet Horace, and the philosopher Seneca--to test the boundaries of how the identity of libertus (""freedman"") affected and failed to affect our authors' literary aims. To deepen our study of how historical conditions shape the creation of freed authorship and the transmission of freed authors, we also read, and consider the conditions surrounding the publication of, American freedpersons' literature."

In the first semester, our content focused on community; we built community as a program of unique individuals to create a common identity and discussed the ways in which the science community exists. The second semester allowed us to explore the life sciences through our lenses of curiosity; we asked big questions and moved toward big answers. This semester is focused on engagement. We will take time to be fully present in the life sciences community and learn why it is important to gain practical knowledge and experiences to further the goals and aims of science."

The field of science communication ventures that the answer is not simply a matter of improving capacity (e.g., because people lack scientific information, scientists lack communication skills, or both). Rather, it calls for sustained collaboration and empathy between laypersons and experts. In this hands-on, experiential course, we use a model of cultural competency to put forth solutions to bridge the expert-lay divide. We investigate typical venues in which science is communicated (museums, YouTube videos, federal agency websites, and much much more) and study best practices for communication. Then we explore emerging venues that support sustained contact between so-called ""lay citizens"" and scientific or technical experts (dance/improv techniques, ethnographic methods and citizen science). Students learn to use cross-cultural perspectives as a basis to pilot and test ways of strengthening relationships and improving communication."

We often take for granted the services infrastructure bring us. As a consequence, the United States, which at one time was a world leader in creating infrastructure, is experiencing an infrastructure crisis. Furthermore, not everyone experiences this issue equally. This course is designed to identify the root causes of the crisis. You will explore emerging social, political, legal, cultural, and social justice issues associated with the building and maintenance of infrastructure from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and engineers. You will work with a volunteer corps of professional engineers from a variety of disciplines on a service-learning project designed to assess the safety and vitality of infrastructure."

In urban areas, the concentration of people and the drastic changes in land use, have altered the fluxes of water, sediments, chemicals, and microorganisms. As the population increases and the number of large urban areas keeps growing (both in U.S. and internationally), managing water in urban areas is becoming more challenging. Water must be supplied for domestic, commercial, and industrial use, as well as irrigation and maintaining and enhancing local environments (e.g., urban streams). In addition, stormwater must be managed to prevent flooding and environmental damage, and used water, which contains organic matter, nutrients, and other constituents that can be extracted and reused, must be collected and managed. In this course we take a systems approach to urban water hydrology, engineering, planning and management. We will explore urban water cycle, urban runoff and drainage characteristics, urban water supply and demand, stormwater collection and treatment and designing best management practices. Additionally, we look at the climate impacts on the urban water cycle."

Our survival depends on reversing this trend. But how? One answer lies just beneath our feet. According tothe UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the top 30 cm of the world'ssoil contains about twice as much carbon as the entire atmosphereand more than is stored in all the vegetation on earth. How can soil become the solution to keep carbon out of the atmosphere? This course explores the critical role soils play not just in our food production, but also in our efforts to prevent the worst effects of climate change.

Second, from a practitioner's perspective, students will explore the U.S. innovation ecosystem in the context of world affairs across industry, academia, government, and venture. By doing so they can also examine potential career paths in building technology power to improve international security.  Third, students will gain practical experience from studying cases in innovation power and build their own tech strategy as a capstone experience. Through all three phases of the class, artificial intelligence will be used as the base case and the most important general purpose technology of our day thus gaining an appreciation for AI itself on one hand, and how it is but one example of how technology can impact the destiny of nations on the other."

Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparent ease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding language requires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficulties with language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, and hearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - the psychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and use language despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge of language is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain."

Nations have sent extended missions to the Moon and Mars, and recently the OSIRIS-Rex brought rocks and dust from the asteroid 101955 Bennu down to Earth. To understand how real life can catch up with fiction (or cannot), we look at liquid crystals, the substances that are the secret of life itself. Liquid crystals are all around and in us. They are the material used in the displays that surround us - telephones, t.v.s, and computers - and the molecules that make life possible. In short, they are essential to us and to everything else that lives. Through a study of liquid crystals and their phases, students will learn the tools to address such pressing concerns as why extremes of temperature and pressure affect life the way they do, and what we can do about it.HNUH228O is part of the Science & Fiction thematic cluster and pairs with HNUH228C to complete the cluster.

Through an exploration of existing AI, like autonomous weapon systems, generative AI, and AI assistants, as well as a visit to UMD's AI department, students will learn to be critical viewers, readers, and developers as they grapple with AI's moral and social implications. Using the context of SF and technological developments, we will explore what the creation, existence, and evolution of fictional and real AI means for technology and humanity.HNUH248R is part of the Artificial?

In 2021, the Taliban took control of the country. Was the U.S. effort doomed to fail? To answer this question, UH students will partner with peers at the American University of Afghanistan through a virtual global classroom to examine the lessons learned from the U.S. and international presence in Afghanistan over the past 20 years. Through reading assignments and virtual meetings with former senior U.S. and Afghan officials, students will examine the reasons behind the downfall of the country and analyze whether the outcome could have been changed. Students are not expected to have any prior knowledge about the conflict in Afghanistan.

It may seem obvious that being poor in childhood has enduring effects on development. What is less obvious is how experiencing poverty in childhood shapes relationships between children and their surroundings, including family interactions, peer relationships, adult dynamics, and the health of the community. Less clear still is the extent to which positive interactions with caretakers and social supports can protect children from potential harm as they grow up. This course focuses on the complexity of poverty as a social force and community concern. Students will investigate the nature of poverty through an interdisciplinary lens that includes social theory, developmental psychology, and empirical studies. After analyzing various approaches to the study of child poverty, students will be in a position to use research on parenting and poverty to evaluate public policy and social programs in their own backyard.HNUH258B is the required I-Series course in the Metamorphosis thematic cluster.

This course will equip and empower you to delve deep into understanding a social issue of your choosing. Through course materials and activities, you'll try out your changemaker muscles and mindsets. Our goal is that this course will empower you to be an informed, engaged citizen who contributes to your community with and beyond your profession. Along the way, we'll address questions like, ""What is social change?"" and ""What happens when our actions have unintended consequences?"" We'll talk about the importance of understanding, empathy, agency, and community, and reflect on how these concepts relate to us as individuals."

Throughout the course, we will witness instances where DT bolsters Visual Communication (VC), and conversely, where VC lends its support to the DT process. Our exploration will revolve around three pivotal questions: How can we engage users and establish meaningful connections with them? How can we empathize with users' challenges and provide them with effective solutions? How can we embrace a holistic approach to design?"
